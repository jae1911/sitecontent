Hey there.  
As you may know, I _love_ the french state when it comes to anything being related to it, [especially the administration related to names](/blog/2022/08/30/changing-names-in-france/).

Well, today, I am happy to announce that my name change request has **finally** been accepted in france.  
It is after more than a year and half to wait and multiple request to the _défenseur des droits_ (or _defender of rights_ when translated) that the embassy finally announced to me that it was accepted.

I'll see you next time in a real article as this one was more of a small announcement rather than a full-blown blog post.
