# VR Dev Log

I recently started making a VR game.  
You will find here most updates.

## 2023-12-17

I spent most of this day playing with tools and setting up the base of the game.  
I the end, I have a flat world with a few objects including a grabbable one!

## 2023-12-18

Today, I spent some time experimenting with basic shaders.

I also added a small debug screen on the back of the right hand:

## 2023-12-19

Today, I added a custom logging framework that basically will dump some data at the start of the game and allows for... logging.

I also finished making basic touch tips to later make buttons and other interractables.

More improvements today, added support for Discord RPC.

Also now exit buttons are functional and exit the game gracefully.

Other improvements are to come, currently working on the initial game area.

## 2023-12-23

Not much today, just some stuff outside of the game itself:

- Setting up the [Itch page for the game](https://j4lc.itch.io/udwxr)

## 2023-12-24

Today, big addition, the first game area was added as well as some fog.  
It's far from finished but a big step nonetheless.
