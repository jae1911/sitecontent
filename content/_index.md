# Welcome to my website!

## About me

Hey there, I'm Jae Lo Presti (AKA J4), I was born in the mountains of Savoy but I'm currently living in Helsinki (Finland).

On my free time, I create content on Resonite as a mentor, including maps, systems, objects and tutorials. I also happen to make 3D art.  
I endorse the role of a technical artist, integrating works into virtual worlds and game engines.
You can check out:

- [My YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@j4l/)
- [My GitLab](https://g.j4.lc)

I also happen to write a bunch of software.

#### I'm also making a VR game! [Check out the devlog!](/pages/vrdevlog)
