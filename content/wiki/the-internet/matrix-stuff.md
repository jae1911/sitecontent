# Matrix stuff

List of random stuff about Matrix like clients, servers and others.

## Clients

 - [Element](https://element.io) - The flagship client for Matrix
 - [Fluffychat](https://fluffychat.im) - Probably the second best client, supports custom emojis, custom stickers, ect; probably works best on mobile
 - [Nheko](https://nheko.im) - Desktop client made with C++; supports custom stickers
 - [Cinny](https://cinny.in) - A client made to ressemble Discord/Slack

## Servers

 - [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/) - A Matrix server made with Python
 - [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite) - A Matrix homeserver made with Golang
 - [Conduit](https://conduit.rs) - A Matrix homeserver made with Rust

## Public rooms

 - [Furry Tech (#furrytech:matrix.org)](https://matrix.to/#/%23furrytech:matrix.org) - Furries... and tech!

## Public servers

Before all, it is recommended to stay away from the default server on Element which is `matrix.org`.  
As it houses too much users, it can be super slow at times and also poses a problem of the instance being a silo of users.

 - [TeDomum.net](https://matrix.tedomum.net) - The Matrix server of the nonprofit `tedomum.net`; requires a custom SSO
 - [The Apothecary](https://the-apothecary.club) - Chill community with a bunch of rooms around Tech, Memes, Media and LGBT
 - [TCHNCS](https://tchncs.de) - Good server with good moderation
