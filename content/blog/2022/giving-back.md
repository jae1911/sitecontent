Hey there!  
As promised [in a previous post](/blog/2022/09/19/thanks-for-the-help!/), I am starting to sponsor various Open-Source projects.  
Here is the list of people I'm sponsoring now:

- [Kavin](https://liberapay.com/kavin) - Maintainer of Piped
- [TeDomum.net](https://liberapay.com/tedomum/) - Collective that hosts Free and Open-Source services

For some reason, the TeDomum donation is set on secret.

If you have any ideas of people or projects I could start donating to, please let me know.  
If you can, I also encourage donating to people that make the software you use every day!

Also, let's not forget the one-time donation to the Debian Project (donated via the "Click & Pledge platform advertised [on the website of the Debian Project](https://www.debian.org/donations#spi-click-n-pledge)):

[![Picture of a receipt from the donation method](https://bm5.jae.fi/ShareX/2022/10/eReceipt.png)](https://bm5.jae.fi/ShareX/2022/10/eReceipt.png)

> As of 2022:10:31T08:23:00+02:00, 100 USD = 100.75EUR. Is censored on the receipt: exact address, phone number, some financial data.

For those who are still donating via LiberaPay, while I appreciate the sentiment, I would ask you to please, please stop them as I don't need them anymore and I haven't found a way to stop donations flowing to me on the dashboard (if you know how, please contact me).  
Again, the warmest, **_thank you_** for supporting me in these hard times.

I'll see you next time!
