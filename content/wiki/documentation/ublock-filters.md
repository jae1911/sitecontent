## Custom filters

Those are my personal lists and filters.

### Anti SEO Garbage

As the name suggests, this removes websites that are just pure SEO garbage.
There are a few versions of that list:

- Basic (only blocks the hosts): `https://g.j4.lc/general-stuff/ublock-filters/-/raw/beep/seo-garbage.txt?ref_type=heads`
- Google (blocks those on Google): `https://g.j4.lc/general-stuff/ublock-filters/-/raw/beep/seo-garbage-google.txt?ref_type=heads`
- Duckduckgo (blocks those on Duckduckgo): `https://g.j4.lc/general-stuff/ublock-filters/-/raw/beep/seo-garbage-duckduckgo.txt?ref_type=heads`
- Yandex (blocks those on Yandex): `https://g.j4.lc/general-stuff/ublock-filters/-/raw/beep/seo-garbage-yandex.txt?ref_type=heads`
