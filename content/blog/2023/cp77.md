Hey there!  
Today, we're having a special post: a game review.  
This one was supposed to come out back in 2020 (so a while ago) when the game originally came out, but bad time management and just forgetting about it made me push it all the way back to today; but hey, better late than never, right?

**This article might contain spoilers about the base game and the DLC Phantom Liberty. Read at your own risk.**

## The game itself

Let's have a bit of a background first shall we?  
Cyberpunk 2077 is a game released in 2020 by Polish game studio CD Projekt Red, most known for the game series The Witcher.

Cyberpunk itself goes back way more, starting in 1988 with Cyberpunk 2013, created and written by Mike Pondsmith, as a tabletop game.  
Later editions included Cyberpunk 2020 (1990), Cyberpunk V3.0 (2005) and Cyberpunk Red (2020).

The Cyberpunk universe takes place in a world where the USA fell to a military coup, collapsing its economy, avoiding the fall of the USSR and strengthening European and Japanese markets, making them stand out as superpowers.  
It's at this time that megacorporations arose, taking control of huge parts of the economy, fighting between themselves and basically starting to form quasi-independent states.  
Technological advancements in term created cyberware (or chrome) which are bioengineered implants used to enhance one's body abilities, leading to cyberpsychosis if too many implants are used.

The main location of the game is called Night City, located on the south of current day San Francisco.  
This autonomous city represents well how the Cyberpunk world works: megacorporations taking over every single aspect of life, rampant crime, violence and corruption.
